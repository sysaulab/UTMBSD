# UTMBSD

As ARM was used almost exclusively in development boards, ISO files were not generally provided for that platform. This made the installation process somewhat unusual and confused less advanced users. A CD installer is available now, but I decided to continue to provide the service as it is my most starred repository. Eventually, I should just take the time and make a proper *BSD template machines and try to upstream it into UTM itself.
